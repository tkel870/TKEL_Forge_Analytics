# BigQuery Homelessness Data Exploration

## Overview
This project explores homelessness data from the BigQuery Public Datasets (HUD Point-in-Time counts) to better understand overall and unsheltered homelessness trends across U.S. Continuums of Care.

## Tools Used
- SQL (Google BigQuery)

## Data Source
- BigQuery Public Dataset: HUD Point-in-Time Homelessness Counts (2010–2018)

### Part 2 – Analysis & Insights
- Identified locations with high overall homelessness but low unsheltered counts
- Calculated unsheltered homelessness percentages
- Compared results across locations to identify effective sheltering outcomes

📄 SQL: [part2.sql](part2.sql)

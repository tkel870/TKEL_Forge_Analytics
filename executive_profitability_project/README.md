Executive Profitability & Customer Risk Analysis
Overview

This project delivers a full-stack executive profitability and customer risk analysis using SQL, Python, spreadsheets, and Tableau.

The objective was to simulate a real-world business analytics engagement by identifying revenue drivers, loss-generating products, and high-risk customers across a multi-category retail dataset.

The analysis demonstrates an end-to-end workflow from raw data ingestion and cleaning through executive-level insight generation and visualization.

This interactive dashboard presents:

Profitability by category and sub-category

Customer risk and unprofitable accounts

Revenue and profit performance overview

Executive-level KPI summary

Tools & Technologies

SQL (SQLite) — data cleaning, transformation, KPI analysis

Python (pandas) — profitability modeling, Pareto analysis, customer risk scoring

Excel / Google Sheets — executive modeling and validation

Tableau — executive dashboard & visualization

GitHub — version control & portfolio presentation

Dataset

~9,994 cleaned transaction records

Multi-category retail sales dataset

Includes revenue, profit, discount, customer, and product data

Currency-formatted fields required cleaning and type conversion

Business Questions

Which product categories generate the most profit?

Which sub-categories are driving losses?

Are there high-revenue customers who are unprofitable?

How concentrated is profit across products?

Where should executives focus to improve margins?

Data Preparation (SQL)

Raw data contained:

Currency formatting ($ and commas)

Text-typed numeric fields

One corrupt row with profit but no sales

Cleaning steps:

Created SQL views to preserve raw data

Removed corrupt rows

Converted currency fields to numeric

Built clean analytical dataset for modeling

This mirrors real-world analyst workflows where raw data is preserved and cleaned views are used for analysis.

Spreadsheet Analysis (Excel / Google Sheets)

Spreadsheets were used to build an executive-facing profitability model and validate SQL outputs.

Key spreadsheet work included:

Revenue and profit validation against SQL results

Category and sub-category profitability summaries

Customer-level profit analysis

Executive KPI summary sheet

Structured analysis designed for business stakeholders

This step ensured calculations were cross-validated and presented in a format accessible to non-technical decision-makers, mirroring real-world business analyst workflows.

Executive KPI Snapshot

Total Revenue: $2.29M

Total Profit: $286K

Profit Margin: 12.47%

Orders: 5,009

Customers: 793

Products: 1,849

Key Findings
1. Category Profitability

Technology and Office Supplies show strong margins (~17%)

Furniture generates significant revenue but only ~2.5% margin

Furniture identified as primary profit risk category

2. Loss-Generating Subcategories

Major loss drivers:

Tables: −$17.7K profit

Supplies: −$11.8K profit

Bookcases: negative margin

These products significantly reduce overall profitability despite strong revenue.

3. Customer Risk Analysis

Multiple customers generated high revenue while producing net losses.

Example:

Customer produced $5.6K revenue but −$6.6K profit

This suggests discounting, shipping costs, or product mix issues creating hidden profitability risk.

4. Profit Concentration (Pareto Analysis)

Approximately 8.9% of products generate 80% of total profit, indicating strong profit concentration and opportunities for targeted growth and pricing optimization.

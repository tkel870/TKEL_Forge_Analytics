# Forensic Genetic Genealogy Candidate Identification  
### TKEL Forge Analytics Portfolio Project

## Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world forensic genetic genealogy investigation workflow. The objective is to analyze DNA match networks, identify clustered relationship groups, and prioritize high-probability investigative candidate pools using structured data analysis.

The analysis demonstrates how SQL, Python, and data visualization tools can be used together to transform complex relational match data into clear investigative insight.

## Investigative Objective
When unidentified remains or cold cases are investigated using consumer DNA databases, analysts must determine which family clusters are most likely connected to the unknown individual.

This project answers:
- Which DNA match clusters are strongest?
- Which clusters contain the most genealogically useful signals?
- Where should investigators focus first?

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (SQLite)
- Python (pandas, NetworkX, Louvain clustering)
- Tableau
- Data modeling & clustering logic
- Investigative-style scoring methodology

## Analytical Workflow
1. Data modeling and schema design in SQL  
2. Network graph construction of shared DNA matches  
3. Community clustering using Louvain algorithm  
4. Cluster scoring and prioritization logic  
5. Geographic and surname signal analysis  
6. Tableau dashboard for investigative decision support  

## Key Outputs
- Clustered DNA match network  
- Candidate priority ranking model  
- Geographic concentration analysis  
- Dominant surname patterns by cluster  
- Interactive investigative dashboard
